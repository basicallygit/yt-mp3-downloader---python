# yt-mp3-downloader---python
downloads mp3 files from a youtube link

ENSURE YOU HAVE PYTUBE INSTALLED AND PYTHON 3.10 OR GREATER
(You can install puytube by opening the terminal and typing "pip install pytube")

just open up the file and it will bring you to a command line where you can put the url of a youtube video to download the mp3 from.

working on a progress bar so you arent sitting in the dark waiting for the file to download

you will have to change the code and input the file destination for yourself (I have already put the file location as downloads as default)
